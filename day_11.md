Today i lean about compiler design. and prepare a summary thats my task today. compiler sourceprogram,errordetect,targerprogram,and source program-preprocessor-modified source program-compiler-target assembly program-assembler-relocatable machine wote-linker/loader-relocatable object file taeget machine code.evening   class lean about. turth propossition A proposition is a statement that can be given one of two truth vaues: it s either true or it is false. Explre how truth values can be placed into a truth table using one of four logic combinations.
maria has a blue dog. Kevin has a purple cat. Joann has a black rat. These are examples of propositions. Propositions, in logic, are statements that can be labeled as either true or false. All of the emples you just heard and saw are complete statements that you can say are eithr true or false
in logic, we sometimes change our original statement to its negative form. We do this by adding a  in the statemet. So, the negative of Maria has a blue dog is Maria does not have a blue dog. Weve added a few words just to make it grammatically corect, but as you can see, we have added a  in the statement. We went from stating that something is hppening to something that is not happening.If our original proposition is in the negative form, then the negatie form of that statement will be a posiive. For example if our original statement is we are not in the year 1990, then the negative of that statement becomes We are in the year 19tthink of the negative as ading a  if there is no  and deleting the  if there isa. You are essentially turning a positive into a negative or a negative into a positive depending on what kind of stateent you begin with.
truth Value.negating a proposition changes its truth value whether the statementis true or false. For example, if the satement She loves to chase squirrels is true, then the negative of the statement,She does not love to chase squirrels,isfalse.
We can creae a simple table to show the truth value of a statement and its negation. We will call our statement p and the negation .we write these in the top row of our truth value table. In the next row, we put T under the p column. Now, if the statement p is true, then its negation  p must be false, so we put F in the same row under the column.
