Algorithm how to do?

Step 1 strt

Step 2to get two number from user.

Step 3 store the number in memory

Step 4 get comment from the user

Step 5 chck the comment
If it is add do step 6
If it is sub, do step 9
If it is mul, do step 7
If it is div, do step 8

Step 6 do the addiction operation and jump to step 10

Step 7 do the multiply and jump to step 10 

Step 8 do the th sub and jump to step 10

Step 9 do the sub and jump to step 10

Step 10 display the answer

Step 11 stop

evening class lean about computer data type
In computer science and computer programming, a data type or simply type is an at tribute of data which tells the compiler or intepreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programing languges support basic data types of integer numbers (of varying size)

String & code
A string is generally considered a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements typically charaters using some character encoding.
eg: ' internship '- single code
    " whight borad "  dobulle code.
