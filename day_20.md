Today lean about token types
The type–token distinction is the difference between naming a class (type) of objets and naming the individual instances (tokens) of that class. Since each typemay be exempified by multiple tokens, there are generally more tokens than typesof an object. For example, the sentence A rose is a rose is a rose contains three word types: three word tokens of the type a three word tokens of the type and two word tokens of the type is. The distincion is important in disciplines such as logi linguistics,metalogic typography and computer programming.
