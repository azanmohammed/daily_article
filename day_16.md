Today i lean about how solve java script eg:find square of 10?-10x10=100-square  of 10 that being said that would be twice as much.the answer will be in this fo rmat- let a=10,let b=10-console.log (a*b):100.

find cube of 15? -15x15x15=3,375-cube of 15- that's three times as much.let a=15
let a=15 let a=15-console.log (a*a*a)=3,375.how this work-a=15,this comment willbe stored in a place like this-console.log(a*a*a*)=the output is that the store comes on display as an answer. 

evening class lean about algorithms-In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well defined instructions typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used asspecifications for performing calculations data procesing automated reasoningautomated decision-making and other tasks.general sense an algorithm is a series ofinstructions telling a computer how to transform a set of facts about the worldinto useful information.The facts are data and the useful information is knowledge for people instuctions for machines or input for yet another algorithm. There are many common examples of algorithms from sorting sets of numbers to finding routes through maps to displaying information on a screen.
