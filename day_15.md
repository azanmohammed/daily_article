                        daily article day_15

today lean about java script & (functionality) the first things i learned from  it.data types-integer,decimal,alphabets,words,fixed things and variable things  and values.assigning a valu to a varible-declaration-operators-anthmetic,assign ment,logical,incrment/decrement,relational and anithmetic operators.subtraction multiplction,how divide using java script (functionality)eg: problam using {1}  anithmetic assigning a value to a variable eg:let a=10,b=15,c=20 this are same
 problem:5+4=9 let A=5, let B=4_console.log (A+b):9-(ans) using all these method s,anita learned to solve evening class.get a task to everyone.Algorithm,divide  into teams and give each team a task given and my team task is give computer in straction mannual- give input go it memory and prouses and output get answer-nn if we test a robot with a given task,we need to show it in paractical from how  it works. Start from the 2nd floor. turn left from the center,walk 10 steps     forword ,can find the switch board and turn  right walk 5 step and turn laft    forward can find the second switch board then turn right walk forward  6 steps, stop trun to left look forward can find the switch turn right walk forward for  5 steps stop then turn left look forward can find the 4th switch.turn right of  walk forward for 8 step,stop turn left and look forword find the 5th switchand  trun right stop turn right and walk 5 steps forward  the wall,stop turn right   and walk 5 steps forward the wall `stop turn left look forward he as the set    find the switch.and i lean about osi architecure-architecture system in which   each layer is defined according to a specific function to perform. All these    seven layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one layer another.  The Upper Layers It deals with application issues and mostly implemented only   in software.that's all for today and i learn so many things.
